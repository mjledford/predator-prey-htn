# predator-prey-htn

## Objective

This project investigates how the frequency of communication between a centralized planner and distributed agents affects performance in a cooperative multi-agent environment. The objective is to design a small predatorâ€“prey simulation where two predator agents coordinate to capture a moving prey using plans generated by a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner. The planner periodically sends updated role assignments and pursuit plans to the agents, which act in the environment using a lookahead controller.
